Generic web application scanning is disabled for this host via the ""Enable generic web application scanning"" option within the ""Global variable settings"" of the scan config in use.

This service is marked as broken and no web application scanning is launched against it. Reason(s):
-----
 - The remote web server is very slow - it took 206 seconds (Maximum response time configured in 'Response Time / No 404 Error Code Check' (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.10386) preferences: 60 seconds) to execute the plugin no404.nasl (it usually only takes a few seconds).

In order to keep the scan total time to a reasonable amount, the remote web server has not been tested.

If the remote server should be tested it has to be fixed to have it reply to the scanners requests in a reasonable amount of time. Alternatively the 'Maximum response time (in seconds)' preference could be raised to a higher value if longer scan times are accepted.
